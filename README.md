## what is cloud native community groups ? 

'The Cloud Native Computing Foundation supports the worldwide community of the Cloud Native Community Groups [[CNCG]](https://community.cncf.io/.)

CNCF is currently working on expanding the Cloud Native community worldwide, and we are happy to accept the new local communities to join our network.

If you are interested in joining the list of official CNCF Community Groups, please review the information below.

 Cloud Native Community Groups program is powered by the [Bevy platform](https://www.bevy.com/), and managed by the CNCF staff.



## Benefits of joining the CNCF Community Groups Program

For all Cloud Native Community Groups, CNCF offers the following benefits:

- One-time complimentary swag certificate ($50 USD) to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io/)
- Boosting the visibility of your community group and events
- Cost coverage for the hosted community platform




## How to apply?

**step 1:**  Visit CNCG offical [site](https://community.cncf.io/)


**step2:**   and click "Log In" at the top right corner 


**step3:**  you will be redirected to the Linux Foundation [sign-in](https://sso.linuxfoundation.org/login/?state=hKFo2SBrOGF5bW9RYjJQZElGcWlWZFpkT2swQ0ZUVndJVkt4UqFupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgQ2FZalZfVXk5SDJYUDFkbllXcHllNnlsS295RTQ2aXWjY2lk2SBBY1ZGUFlMTGZXdHh2dW83TUpDeldPcVQ5ZkJMY1B0Tg&client=AcVFPYLLfWtxvuo7MJCzWOqT9fBLcPtN&protocol=oauth2&redirect_uri=https:%2F%2Fcommunity.cncf.io%2Faccounts%2Fauth0%2Flogin%2Fcallback%2F&scope=email%20openid%20profile&response_type=code). Use your credentials or create a new account.
Please provide additional information via filling the [form](https://forms.gle/HaTM3d5vbHWop8qQ6).

_#Note: this form is used for inviting the new Community Groups organizers only. If an active Community Group already exists in your region, please reach out to the organizers directly   (do not use the form above)_


**step 4:**  Once completed, CNCF staff will provide you with access to your group.

### How to enable the sync with Meetup.com?

- The integration syncs events from Bevy to Meetup. It connects your Bevy group with your existing Meetup group and helps track member attendance and analytics. This integration requires adding the CNCF Meetup Pro account as a co-organizer on your Meetup group.

- The "CNCF Meetup Account" has to be added to your Meetup Group (CNCF staff is managing this account), so please apply via the form above mentioning the Meetup Group URL. If you run multiple groups, please apply every time with the new group URL.

- Once the CNCF account joins your group, you'll need to follow the "Appoint New Leadership Member" steps [here](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002879411-Managing-a-leadership-team) to add " cncf-meetup-admin@cncf.io " as a co-organizer. Please see the sample video on how to do this [here.](https://share.getcloudapp.com/8LujxJ85)

_**Please note:**

_the events sync between Bevy and Meetup is only available to the groups that have already joined the [CNCF Meetup Pro network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf) before July 1st, 2020!_

_To have the events sync with Meetup.com working correctly, please make sure that the "CNCF Meetup Account" is added to your group as a co-organizer! If this is not done, Bevy won't be able to create events on Meetup!_
_he steps described above do not migrate the existing users from a Meetup group to the new Community Group. This can be done as a one-off manual step by CNCF staff after your_ _application is accepted and processed. To migrate users, please file a request to meetups@cncf_







## Communication

Please reach out to us on the #communitygroups channel on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).

Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and
others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the program admins a note via meetups@cncf.io **(please use the public channels for any program-related discussion).**

> Answers for FAQ's :

### What is the status of the Cloud Native Meetups?

CNCF meetups have grown to nearly ~200 [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf) across the world. The current meetup platform may disappear in the future due to business continuity risks and also isn't as fully featured as we desire. Thus, CNCF is moving the meetups to a new platform, hosted by [Bevy](https://www.bevy.com/) and building out a new community that will be inclusive of more types of events than just meetups.



### When will the transition to the community platform happen?

We've be rolled the community.cncf.io platform in July 2020 and letting community groups migrate to this. In 2021, we'll discontinue our use of Meetup.com and exclusively use the Bevy-backed platform for community groups.



### How do I sync Meetup Pro with CNCG?

Bevy has custom integration with the Meetup Pro and allows syncing groups, members, and events between two platforms. However, please note that the synchronization between Bevy and Meetup Pro will be available during the transition period only (by the end of 2021).

Please see more details on the Meetup/Bevy integration on the [Bevy help portal.](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/335-how-to-connect-to-meetup-pro)



### How can I migrate the users from Meetup to CNCG

This can be done as a one-off manual step by CNCF staff after your application is accepted and processed. Please note that only the Meetup users who have made their emails on Meetup public could be migrated.



### Events created on CNCG have not been added to my Meetup page automatically

To have the bidirectional sync with Meetup.com working correctly, please make sure that the "CNCF Meetup Account" is added to your group as a co-organizer. If this is not done, Bevy won't be able to create events on Meetup!



### Will the pricing policy change?

CNCF will cover all costs for the hosted community platform.



### How does the social coverage/network of Bevy compare to Meetup.com?

The events on a new platform will benefit from the CNCF Marketing team's power and coverage. Compared to the Meetup.com-hosted events, the new platform allows hosting the events under the cncf.io domain and embedding more deeply into the marketing tools and technologies currently used by CNCF for the networking outreach. Furthermore, CNCF is committed to marketing meetups and events across our platforms.



### How often are the Cloud Native Community Groups applications reviewed?

We review the CNCG applications weekly, and if your submission satisfies our requirements and best practices, we'll send you an invitation.



### Do I need to re-apply?

No, once you formally apply, you are a part of the pool of applicants.



### Does CNCF offer promotional support for the Community Groups?

CNCF is happy to offer marketing support for the Community Groups in some exceptional cases.

Also, please make sure that you are aware of other community-focused CNCF programs, including [CNCF Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) and [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/).



### I'd like to get in touch with the CNCF ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who a local ambassador is?
