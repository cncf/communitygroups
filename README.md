## Meetup Best Practices

This page provides guidance on starting a new meetup group based on the experience of existing ones.

Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:

### Naming Convention

If you start a brand new meetup that aims to cover the whole Cloud Native landscape, we recommend to use one of the following **naming** convention:

```
Cloud Native Computing <Location>
Kubernetes <Location>
Prometheus <Location>
<Other CNCF-hosted project name> <Location>
```

Please, do not use any commercial brand or product names in the meetup name.

### **Create the meetup**

The **description** of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers.

A brief description of the role of the CNCF and the Cloud Native approach could be added.

You can use text from the [Cloud Native Definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md).

In order for your meetup to be the as visible as possible you should add a relevant list of **tags**.

(For example, "Cloud Computing", "DevOps", "Cloud Native", "Docker", "Containers", "Serverless", "Microservices", "Kubernetes", etc.)

The most important thing is to keep an **active group**, with frequent events (ideally once a month).

Sustaining a group yourself can be difficult to manage. Ideally you should have a team of passionate and committed co-organizers.

Joining forces helps spread the load and expands the network.


### **Find Speakers**

You should provide some kind of **form** in order to allow people to submit their talk proposal similar to this:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1V2Y03YMOrIor0M796_WMbYx-fdsn80ngaT-PIum8gUU/edit

> _**Note**_: Make a copy! Please do not edit that form.

When possible take care to review their presentations.

Attend **conferences** (e.g. DockerCon, CloudNativeCon...) where you can find speakers and meet a lot of people who use or are involved in the CNCF projects that may be interested in joining your group.

### **Find sponsors/place**

You should contact local technology companies. Many of them are interested in hosting such kind of events.

It is better to find a place in a central location. Downtown would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of attendees.

### **Schedule a new event**

First of all don't forget to thank your sponsors.

Then the most important information is about the agenda, each talk description should contains:

    - A short bio of the speaker
    - An attractive title
    - A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo

If you're planning a hands-on demo, you should ensure that the WiFi can handle the number of attendees.

Furthermore you should check you're not limited by some kind of quotas (Cloud provider).

The choice of date and time matters. Most of meetups choose Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after work.

### **Booking**

If you're limited by the room capacity, you should do an **overbooking**.

Most of the time there are 30% of people who RSVP but they never come.

You should think about sending a **reminder** message to the meetup group to ask the people to free their place if they can't come.

### **Post event**

If possible you should record videos of the presentations and take pictures for social media and the event page to share  afterwards.

You should also **share** the slides with all members after the event. Optionally, please submit them to the [CNCF Presentations repo](https://github.com/cncf/presentations) on GitHub.

### **CNCF swag**
If you're a newly created meetup and added to meetups.cncf.io, please reach out to info@cncf.io for a complimentary $50 swag certificate to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io).

### **Ask for help**


If you have any other questions, you can ask them in the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/).
