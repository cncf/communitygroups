## Program description

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation supports the worldwide community of Cloud Native Community Groups (CNCGs) - [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io).
CNCF is currently working on expanding the Cloud Native community worldwide, and we are happy to accept any new local communities to join our network.
If you are interested in joining the list of official CNCF Community Groups, please review the information below.
As of 2021, Cloud Native Community Groups program is powered by the Bevy platform, and managed by the CNCF staff.

### Technical Community Groups

A [Technical Community Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/governance/tag-governance.md#technical-community-groups) is focused primarily on identifying and discussing a particular technical scope, technology, or problem space. This type of community group is expected to have one or more monthly virtual meetings, and may also have in-person meetups.

### Regional Community Groups

A Regional Community Group is the long-standing, traditional type of community group in CNCF. This type of group is primarily focused on building relationships among cloud native end users and contributors in a particular region. It is expected to have one or more in-person meetups per year, and may also have virtual meetings.

## Benefits of joining the CNCF Community Groups Program

For all Cloud Native Community Groups, CNCF offers the following benefits:

- One-time complimentary swag coupon of $100 USD to the CNCF Store provided to each community group (not to each organizer), is available after hosting 2 successful (over 10 people attended) in-person events per chapter within 3 months or 90 days. NOTE: Registration must happen within the Bevy platform for this coupon to be earned. Requesting your voucher - write to community-groups@cncf.io with a link to your past Bevy event pages. We will make an exception for virtual events, if your event has over 100 attendees.
- Joining the CNCF organizer-exclusive Slack channel for collaboration
- Boosting the visibility of your community group and events. See below under the “Communication” section for more details.
- 25% discount to Linux Foundation training exams for CKAD and KCNA.
- Discounts to KubeCon + CloudNativeCons around the world
- Cost coverage for the hosted community platform, Bevy
  - This includes support from CNCF (Audra Montenegro and Katie Greenley).
  - And quarterly tips and tricks session hosted by Bevy expert Maia Walshe
- Office hours hosted once per week in different time zones. [See what works best for you](https://community.cncf.io/central-city/), and bring your questions about anything related to CNCF community groups.
- Credly badges for organizers! We would like to recognize your efforts for helping make Cloud Native ubiquitous. To qualify, each December we will see if you have been an organizer for the duration of the year, and your chapter has hosted at least 1 in-person meetup every 90 days (4 times a year) with no deactivations. Registrations must be via CNCF's community platform (community.cncf.io).
- 5 free certification vouchers for remaining an active chapter year-round. This means at least one (1) in-person event each quarter with more than 10 attendees (not just registrations). So keep track of your check-in in Bevy! These badges are distributed in January the following year.

✒️ NOTE: With over 200 active global chapters, we cannot monetarily support your community group with sponsorships outside what is listed above, but we are always looking into adding more incentives.

## Best Practices

Please check out our [best_practices](./best_practices.md).

## How to apply?

Applications can now be submitted via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new-group-request.yaml&title=%5BGroup+Request%5D+Create+a+new+chapter). Once a GitHub issue is filed, there will be a 30-day grace period. If you do not hear back after that amount of time has passed, please reach out to community-groups@cncf.io.

## Bevy Training

Bevy is the platform that backs community.cncf.io. With over 190 ACTIVE chapters (as of 2024), Bevy allows for in-person and virtual meetups, co-hosting, emailing your attendees, transparent analytics for organizers, and a microsite (small website) that can feature sponsors, speakers, and more!

- CNCF and Bevy have organized the training session for the Community Groups organizers. It has been recorded and now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBdomoYlmc).
- You can also access the Bevy Help Portal at <https://help.bevylabs.com/>.
- [Bevy FAQ can be found here](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/blob/main/FAQ.md).
- If you want to test video features, you can use: <https://tokbox.com/developer/tools/precall/>

### Support

- If you have any technical difficulties with the platform itself, please reach out to the Bevy platform support by clicking the purple question mark in the bottom right corner of your Bevy chapter dashboard.
- Troubleshooting: The troubleshooting guide by Bevy is available here: [help.bevylabs.com/article/499-troubleshooting](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/499-troubleshooting)
- Last resort, you can reach out to Audra Montenegro in the CNCF Slack workspace to help you, especially if it is time sensitive.

## Naming your chapter

Please use "Cloud Native CITY NAME" when naming your chapter. We ask that you avoid using "CNCF" in the naming convention, as it can mislead people into think CNCF has employees in that location. You may, however, use a tag line that states something similar to, "An official CNCF community group (or chapter)."

"CNCG" is an internal acronym we currently use at CNCF and among organizers, but it has not yet gained traction. So we encourage people to avoid using it in the names of their chapters, as of 2023.

## Communication

We strive to keep all organizers as up to date as possible when it comes to program updates and changes. Here are a few ways you can stay in the loop:

- Subscribe to our global organizer newsletter by going to your [community profile and then "updates"](https://community.cncf.io/accounts/profile/#updates). There you can opt-in by marking the "Global" checkbox under the "Receive general communications from" header.
- Please reach out to us on the #communitygroups channel on the CNCF slack. Please avoid using direct messages unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.
- It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the program admins a note via community-groups@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any program-related discussion).

## Marketing Best Practices and Resources

### Social Media

We encourage each chapter to create their own social media accounts on the platforms that are most relevant in their local area, in addition to LinkedIn so CNCF can properly help amplify your announcements.

CNCF is present on [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloud-native-computing-foundation/mycompany/) with over 100,000 followers on each, and a growing number of followers on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cncf.io). If you are a CNCF chapter promoting your community on community.cncf.io, then CNCF will be happy to help you promote your meetups on social media. Simply join the [#socialmedia channel in the CNCF Slack workspace](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C12MRQ97A) asking for amplifications of your post. CNCF staff automatically check that channel each day. Each CNCG is limited to one post amplification per week. NOTE: In the spirit of vendor neutrality, CNCF will not amplify sponsor posts.

IMPORTANT: Every LinkedIn page created should be created as a company page, and must add CNCF's core community program manager, Audra Montenegro as an admin.

### Common things to promote in your meetups

- Speakers and their content! This is the most attractive thing to your audience
- The details! Tell people when, where, and the location of your meetup
- Food and beverage! What refreshments will you will be providing
- Promote your sponsors! They will appreciate the shout out. You do this by thanking them for sponsoring your event and showcasing their logo. They also appreciate you linking to their website or their open source resource or insights (more attractive to this audience)
- Giveaways! Not everyone will have this opportunity, over time you will generate sponsors for this, or [earn a voucher from us](README.md#benefits-of-joining-the-cncf-community-groups-program).

### Promotional Graphics

Here we have some templates in Canva that will at least help you with sizing and placement of key content:

- [LinkedIn and Facebook](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDoVUWY9w/QwHhJgCuoEFvefVxQIGJ2w/view?)
- [Twitter](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDoQ6zx2c/5ym4UFerINEdRlgEyHmTuA/view?)
- [Instagram](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDoXtCdB4/CIqyQVHUcfmq_AcDswEMVw/view?)

### Partnering with other communities

This is acceptable, as long as it is a general tech community or open source community. Usually the exchange is presence at their events, and your brand recognition. CNCF just asks you do not market their events to your members.

## Community Group Inactivity

If your group has more than 90 days of inactivity in the number of events/meetups being held, then you will be deemed an “Inactive” group via the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and removed from [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io/).

Technical Community Groups that fail to meet at least six times in a calendar year will also be considered inactive.

There are many ways to keep your chapter active outside of regular in-person, speaker-to-audience meetups. Examples are:

- Co-hosting a meetup with a neighboring chapter. [Learn about the Co-Host feature in Bevy](https://youtu.be/rEKoZ5OAGpo).
- Host a study group for one of the many Kubernetes certifications
- Use Bevy's virtual feature to host a virtual meetup or study group

Should a community group violate vendor neutrality — a CNCF core value — the following path towards deactivation will occur.

- 1st offense = a written violation via email
- 2nd offense = a community meeting with organizers for final warning
- 3rd offense = disabling your chapter

## Code of Conduct

Cloud Native Community Groups follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
