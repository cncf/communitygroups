Cloud Native Computing Foundation Community Groups
==================================================

Program description
-------------------

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation supports the worldwide community of the Cloud Native Community Groups (CNCG) - https://community.cncf.io/.

CNCF is currently working on expanding the Cloud Native community around the globe, and we are happy to accept the new local communities to join our network.

If you are interested in joining the list of official CNCF Community Groups, please review the information below on this page.

Cloud Native Community Groups program is powered by the [Bevy platform](https://www.bevy.com/), and managed by the CNCF staff.

Benefits of joining the CNCF Community Groups Program
-----------------------------------------------------

For all Cloud Native Community Groups, CNCF offers the following benefits:

-	One-time complimentary swag certificate to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io/)
-	Boosting the visibility of your community group and events
-	Cost coverage for the hosted community platform

Best Practices
--------------

This page provides guidance on starting a new Cloud Native Community Group based on the experience of existing ones.

Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:

### Naming Convention

If you start a brand new group that aims to cover the whole Cloud Native landscape, we recommend to use one of the following **naming** convention:

```
Cloud Native Computing <Location>
Kubernetes <Location>
Prometheus <Location>
<Other CNCF-hosted project name> <Location>
```

Please, do not use any commercial brand or product names in the meetup name.

### **Create the Cloud Native Community Group**

First of all, please follow the official [Bevy documentation on how to create a chapter](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/454-create-a-chapter).

The **description** of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers.

A brief description of the role of the CNCF and the Cloud Native approach could be added.

You can use text from the [Cloud Native Definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md).

The most important thing is to keep an **active group**, with frequent events (ideally once a month). We encourage folks to run either online events or the regular meetup events.

Sustaining a group yourself can be difficult to manage. Ideally you should have a team of passionate and committed co-organizers.

Joining forces helps spread the load and expands the network.

### **Find Speakers**

You should provide some kind of **form** in order to allow people to submit their talk proposal similar to this:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1V2Y03YMOrIor0M796_WMbYx-fdsn80ngaT-PIum8gUU/edit

> ***Note***: Make a copy! Please do not edit that form.

When possible take care to review their presentations.

Attend **conferences** (e.g. DockerCon, CloudNativeCon...) where you can find speakers and meet a lot of people who use or are involved in the CNCF projects that may be interested in joining your group.

### **Find sponsors/place**

You should contact local technology companies. Many of them are interested in hosting such kind of events.

It is better to find a place in a central location. Downtown would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of attendees.

### **Schedule a new event**

First of all don't forget to thank your sponsors.

Then the most important information is about the agenda, each talk description should contains:

```
- A short bio of the speaker
- An attractive title
- A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo
```

If you're planning a hands-on demo, you should ensure that the WiFi can handle the number of attendees.

Furthermore you should check you're not limited by some kind of quotas (Cloud provider).

The choice of date and time matters. Most of meetups choose Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after work.

### **Booking**

If you're limited by the room capacity, you should do an **overbooking**.

Most of the time there are 30% of people who RSVP but they never come.

You should think about sending a **reminder** message to the meetup group to ask the people to free their place if they can't come.

### **Post event**

If possible you should record videos of the presentations and take pictures for social media and the event page to share afterwards.

You should also **share** the slides with all members after the event. Optionally, please submit them to the [CNCF Presentations repo](https://github.com/cncf/presentations) on GitHub.

### **CNCF swag**

If you're a newly created meetup and added to meetups.cncf.io, please reach out to meetups@cncf.io for a complimentary $50 swag certificate to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io).

### **Ask for help**

If you have any other questions, you can ask them in the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/).

How to apply?

### FAQ

#### What is the status of the Cloud Native Meetups?

CNCF meetups have grown to nearly ~200 [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf) across the world. The current meetup platform may disappear in the future due to business continuity risks and also isn’t as fully featured as we desire. Thus, CNCF is moving the meetups to a new platform, hosted by [Bevy](https://www.bevy.com/) and building out a new community that will be inclusive of more types of events than just meetups.

#### When will the transition to the community platform happen?

We’ll be rolling this out in July 2020 and letting community groups migrate to this. In 2021, we’ll be discontinuing our use of Meetup.com and exclusively using the Bevy-backed platform for community groups.

#### How do I sync meetup pro with CNCG?

Bevy has custom integration with the Meetup Pro, and allows syncing groups, members and events between two platforms. However, please note that the synchronization between Bevy and Meetup Pro will be available during the transition period only (by January 2021).

Please see more details on the Meetup/Bevy integration on the Bevy help portal

-	https://help.bevylabs.com/article/335-how-to-connect-to-meetup-pro.

#### Will the pricing policy change?

-	CNCF will cover all costs for the hosted community platform.

#### How does the social coverage/network of Bevy compare to Meetup.com?

The events on a new platform will benefit from the CNCF Marketing team’s power and coverage. Compared to the Meetup.com-hosted events, the new platform allows hosting the events under the cncf.io domain and embedding more deeply into the marketing tools and technologies currently used by CNCF for the networking outreach. Furthermore, CNCF is committed to marketing meetups and events across our platforms.

#### How often are the Cloud Native Community Groups applications reviewed?

We review the CNCG applications on a montly basis, and if your submission satisfies our requirements and best practices, we'll send you an invitation.

#### Do I need to re-apply?

No, once you formally apply you are part of the pool of applicants that get reviewed on a monthly basis.

#### Does CNCF offer the promotional support for the Community Groups?

CNCF is happy to offer the marketing support for the Community Groups in some exceptional cases.

Also, please make sure that you are aware of other community-focused CNCF programs, including [CNCF Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) and [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/).

#### I'd like to get in touch with the CNCF ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who is a local ambassador?

Here is [a map of the CNCF Ambassadors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fb0UPi8ijeexueBxcpGuvVlZ_8hJHXVQ&usp=sharing).

### Code of Conduct

Cloud Native Community Groups follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
