### Support

- If you have any technical difficulties with the platform itself, please reach out to the [Bevy platform support by clicking the purple question mark in the bottom right corner of your Bevy chapter dashboard.
- Troubleshooting: The troubleshooting guide by Bevy is available here: [help.bevylabs.com/article/499-troubleshooting](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/499-troubleshooting)
- Last resort, you can reach out to Audra Montenegro in the CNCF Slack workspace to help you, especially if it is time senstive.

## Naming your chapter

Please use "Cloud Native CITY NAME" when naming your chapter. We ask that you avoid using "CNCF" in the naming convention, as it can misslead people into think CNCF has employees in that location. You may, however, use a tag line that states something similar to, "An official CNCF community group (or chapter)."

"CNCG" is an internal acronym we currenyly use at CNCF and among organizers, but it has not yet gained traction. So we encourage people to avoid using it in the names of their chapters, as of 2023.

## Communication

Please reach out to us on the #communitygroups channel on the CNCF slack. Please avoid using direct messages unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the program admins a note via meetups@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any program-related discussion).

The #socialmedia channel via the CNCF slack workspace is a great place to post your social media efforts requesting assistance from CNCF to amplify. Just tag Katie Meinders and Jessie Adams-Shore to help amplify your social post.


## Community Group Inactivity

If your group has more than 90 days of inactivity in the number of events/meetups being help, then you will be deemed an “Inactive” group via the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and removed from [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io/)

Should a community group violate vendor neutrality, a CNCF core value, the following path towards deactivation will ocur.
* 1st offense = a written violation via email
* 2nd offense = a community meeting with organizers for final warning
* 3rd offense = disabling your chapter

## Code of Conduct

Cloud Native Community Groups follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
